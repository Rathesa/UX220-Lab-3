        <h2> Red </h2>
        <p> A movie that features the actor Bruce Willis. In this movie he plays Frank a retired government worker who is living of his pension checks. Frank's calls to the government pension centre, where he gets to speak with his case worker Sarah.</p>
        <p> In order to continue talking to Sarah, he keeps tearing up his checks. Then one day, masked intruders with large weapons attack his home. While making his getaway, his home is destroyed. After meeting Sarah, he kidnaps her and makes her believe that she is in danger. His file is marked as "R.E.D." (Retired Extremely Dangerous), so he breaks into the C.I.A. headquarters and asks the Russians for help. </p>
        <p> This movie is one of the best, as it is a mixture of action,mystery,love and comedy. I watch this movie so much,that my friends and family are sick of it. So I definitely recommend this movie to watch with your family!</p>
